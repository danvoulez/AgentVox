# CI/CD Strategy for AgentVox

This document outlines the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment strategy for the AgentVox project.

## CI Strategy (Continuous Integration)

Our CI pipeline is configured to run automatically on every push to the `master`, `main`, and `develop` branches, as well as on all pull requests targeting these branches.

### CI Pipeline Steps:

1. **Code Checkout**: The latest code is checked out from the repository.
2. **Environment Setup**: Node.js environment is set up with the correct version.
3. **Dependency Installation**: All dependencies are installed using `npm ci` for consistent builds.
4. **Linting**: Code quality is checked using ESLint.
5. **Building**: The application is built to ensure there are no compilation errors.
6. **Testing**: Unit and integration tests are run to verify functionality.

### CI Benefits:

- Early detection of integration issues
- Consistent code quality enforcement
- Automated testing to catch regressions
- Faster feedback loop for developers

## CD Strategy (Continuous Deployment)

Our CD pipeline is triggered automatically when changes are pushed to the `master` or `main` branch, indicating that code is ready for production.

### CD Pipeline Steps:

1. **Frontend Deployment**:
   - Code is checked out from the repository
   - Vercel CLI is installed and configured
   - Environment variables are pulled from Vercel
   - Application is built for production
   - Built artifacts are deployed to Vercel

2. **Database Migrations**:
   - Supabase CLI is installed and configured
   - Connection is established to the Supabase project
   - Database migrations are applied
   - Post-deployment scripts are executed

### CD Benefits:

- Automated, consistent deployments
- Reduced manual errors
- Quick delivery of new features to users
- Synchronized database schema updates

## Environment Configuration

The CI/CD pipelines require the following secrets to be configured in GitHub:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: The URL of your Supabase project
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: The anonymous key for your Supabase project
- `VERCEL_TOKEN`: API token for Vercel deployments
- `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Access token for Supabase CLI
- `SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID`: The ID of your Supabase project

## Branching Strategy

We follow a simplified Git Flow branching strategy:

- `master`/`main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for features
- `feature/*`: Feature branches for development
- `hotfix/*`: Branches for urgent fixes

## Deployment Environments

- **Development**: Automatically deployed from the `develop` branch
- **Production**: Automatically deployed from the `master`/`main` branch

## Rollback Strategy

In case of deployment issues:

1. Identify the issue through monitoring and alerts
2. Revert to the last known good commit in the `master`/`main` branch
3. Trigger a new deployment with the reverted code
4. Fix the issue in a separate branch and follow the normal deployment process

## Monitoring and Alerting

- Vercel provides deployment status and performance metrics
- Supabase offers database performance monitoring
- Custom application monitoring is implemented using logging and error tracking services

This CI/CD strategy ensures that AgentVox maintains high quality standards while enabling rapid, reliable delivery of new features and improvements.
